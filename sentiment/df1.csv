,Gender Comp
0,i don't think there should be gender specific academic or skill competitions. everyone should be able to compete against each other and may the best person/team win.
1,"i'm against it. i think academic and mental competitions should be integrated. it sends a message to the ""dominant"" group i guess, that their skills couldn't compete."
2,"it's not terrible. working only in these spheres will probably limit some people, but having an arena with less worry of prejudice to dip into could be good for the same reasons i listed before. note, i'm talking about things like this for genders who have historically been excluded from these skills or activities. having a women-only nursing event or a men-only coding event just reinforces existing exclusionary sentiment."
3,negative opinions. we should be including women not excluding men. or else we're no better!
4,"i think these competitions should be more inclusive, focused on skills rather than gender or race. the groups/communities provide the support needed to thrive in these competitions."
5,"my initial reaction is that i feel less positive about gender specific competitions. in my academic career, i never considered my performance against a particular gender, but against the entire population. there are very likely valid, logical reasons to hold gender specific competitions, but i would fear some may use a gender qualifier to ""discount"" the competition quality."
6,"seeing as i helped found the female case competition, my answer here is predictable: i fully support these endeavors. in the beginning of my college career, i did not support these competitions. i thought it was counter productive to what society tries to foster, because in the real workplace, the goal is a diverse team, not a one-gender team like my competition seemingly promoted. however, my opinion changed when i actually looked at the statistics - 1 out of 4 case competition participants were women, while the rest male when our school has about a 50/50 ratio. i did some research into why women weren't participating - it had to do with investment of time vs. reward, and the ""confidence gap"" (http://www.forbes.com/sites/margiewarrell/2016/01/20/gender-confidence-gap/#2ac3ba4a4f72) that women experience. by creating a safer zone for women to experience case competitions, we've seen participation rise in normal case competitions due to this introductory experience"
7,demoralizing
8,same as above
9,"that would be interesting- but i do think any competitions should best prepare people for the working world. in the future, it would be rare that i competed on an all women's engagement against only women. the best ideas come from groups that have a wide range of skills and expertise."
10,"i think the pr/audience value (look how awesome all these women are) is higher than the value for the participants. if you're competing, you don't realy care if you're winning against boys or girls."
11,"i think they should combine the genders. while these are not discriminatory, they do not represent a real workplace"
12,it's condescending and i think counter-productive. when it comes to competitions why would you send the message that women can only compete with women? it's also not helping men and women learn how to collaborate or win/lose to each other. the world does not have gender-specific anything- it's the wrong approach. interest groups are support networks- they're different.
13,a gender specific competition seems like it would isolate one gender and present a scenario different from the male-and-female dynamic of the real world or workplace.
14,"seems to me that women can compete in science fairs as well as men, why have a separate one?"
15,excellent - these competitions raise awareness for the problem of gender discrimination and actively try to solve it by promoting engagement in these disciplines.
16,probably would not participate in one
17,"athletics is the only place i find it right when it comes to skills/academics. if it's not a physical competition where genetically, skill sets will be different, then genders should all be on the same playing field."
18,"i see the value, it'd just be nice if someone not of the gender can help out in someway such as planning or promoting it"
19,"i think these opportunities make sense as what i call a gateway opportunity. if women are underrepresented in computer science / hackathon competitions (which they are), providing an opportunity such as a women-specific competition makes sense to encourage them to participate in more competitions like this in the future."
20,oooh said it above.
21,don't see the benefit or value
22,"i see no purpose for gender specific competitions. i do support those for younger generations, like empowering young females in stem careers because of the lack of involvement."
23,seems exclusive
24,disagree. it should be a level-playing field since that translates to real-world competition.
25,not into it
26,"i honestly don't think that these are necessary and only further divide the female/male bias. if we continue these gender specific competitions, then we propagate the idea that they are not on equal footing for competing."
27,"love them! great opportunity for minority groups to showcase their talent! sometimes when an especially talented or gifted person participates in events, their talent is slapped with labels like ""they only won because they are black"" or ""they only got chosen for the diversity card."" diversity targeted events remove that label and show others the power of the group as a whole!"
28,i think they are great as a practice for the coed versions. a place for constructive criticism from female mentors in the field. final competitons need to be coed.
29,go for it. stem is a place where women are minorities. need more women in stem education amd careers!
30,i've never participated in one and would not be interested in doing so. this does not sound beneficial to myself or to the particular gender.
31,
32,good opportunity to showcase the achievements of one population. should be included in a variety of opportunities and not be the sole activity.
33,"again, why not? maybe we can figure out a way for projects to be judged anonymously. otherwise, unconscious (and sometimes conscious) biases will always play a part"
34,"this one i'm not as comfortable with, because it's not about the shared experience, it feels more like excluding the other half of the population from an opportunity. now, if the women in tech group were to sponsor an open science fair that asked for entries that are maybe focused on something relating to women (i dunno, effective ways to handle menstruation, better breast pump, sustainable tech for women in impoverished countries....) that would be awesome, because even male participants could participate in breaking down barriers and we need allies!"
35,"i mean it allows women or men to work in groups that are only their gender which might be a valuable skill. also, women in mixed gender competitions might be at a disadvantage if judges notice and judge male characteristics more highly than female. i don't think about it much, i guess."
36,i believe we need to encourage participation of diverse groups -- at which point the competition becomes open to all. i'd want my daughter and my son to be in academic competitions that reflect the real world they're living in and will be having careers in
37,"i think these are effective when there is a clear lack of opportunity in the field in which the competition pertains. obviously, the women's case competition has ruffled some feathers, and i think that's because our friend groups views case comps as equal opportunity fields already. but when you look at coding or other stem-fields, there is so clearly still a difference in opportunity that gender-specific competitions may help to bridge the divide."
38,"i think gender specific is okay, especially in sports, but i think in science it shouldn't matter if you are a boy or girl. while it's important to build strong communities that can foster change in the wider audience -- i don't think its 100% required to be gender specific."
39,"tough, although it's great to empower women with these resources it's also discriminatory to others"
40,same
41,i am indifferent.
42,"i am for these competions, with the understanding that there is value in joining coed competitions. while i am currently chairing the women's case competition, i am also a member in other coed organizations and competed in coed case competitions. to me, these competitions create a bonding point for its participants in order to deliver the message of female empowerment, because sadly, not every women believes that she is equal and has equal capabilities as her male peers. we tell all of the participants that we want them to compete in coed case competitions in the future. i hope that one day, there will no longer be a need for a women's case competition, and that female case competition participation rate will be at 50%."
43,"not productive or conducive to celebrate the achievements of people. the more competitions are divided, the more silo-ed the conversation becomes."
44,"i have mixed feelings about these... in one way i think it is a good way to encourage entries (for example, in a science fair) but at the same time, i think it encourages the mindset that women can't keep up with the men. have a female only science fair to give the girls a chance because they wouldn't have a chance against the boys. and that is just incorrect."
45,i think that they are fine and probably empower women. however making competitions less diverse probably cheapens the overall merits entitled to the winner.
46,"i have mixed feelings here. women now receive higher levels of education than men, yet they are still underrepresented in certain disciplines. i think that gender-specific scholarships are a positive way to encourage women to participate in fields that are dominated by men. but, i also think that at the earliest levels of education we should not train children to believe that their gender will determine their success in a certain subject (e.g. elementary math teachers expecting poorer scores for female children versus male or vice versa with elementary english teachers). so, we should make all academic opportunities as inclusive as possible."
47,not as familiar with this so not sure but i would think in some.cases especially dealing with youth it is not appropriate
48,"i think it depends on the intentions of the event. pertaining to the women's case competition i gained a lot of value being a part of the competition for two years. i wouldn't say i was intimidated by mccombs-wide case competitions because they are male-dominated, but rather because i've never done one before and knew students who competed in the mccombs-wide competitions are pretty frequent competitors. i think the women's case competition was great for me because it achieved what it's meant to do... creates a competition marketed specially for women, to then encourage further involvement in case competitions in the future. it ties back to the questions regarding gender based organizations -- it's a feeling of community. including having a women mba mentor who wowd me with her passion and experience with case competitions."
49,less supportive. not sure the distinction is necessary. the point is to remove the gender bias and having a women only competition defeats the purpose.
50,"in general, i think gender specific competitions should be enforced in areas where that gender is generally not encouraged to participate or is drastically underrepresented. these competitions should aim to encourage higher rates of participation so that eventually there will be equal amounts of each gender in the competition. competition coordinators should keep a close eye on interest and"
51,hmmm this i kinda have a problem with. if a co ed school is throwing these... no. if the organization listed above are hosting them ... yes.
52,"im pretty sure someone would get upset at a ""boys only"" event, but they still happen. i dont see them any different then other specifically focused activity."
53,i think it can be a way to really see and feel empowered by your fellow female peers. it is inspiring and also a way to expand your own network.
54,"similar to race specific competitions, i think it is great to bring all women together who are as competitive/successful as themselves as a prideful momento. however, it defeats the purpose of moving up in society as a woman trying to compete with men in the workplace."
55,"unknown. maybe i got lucky and just beat all the boys when i won science and math stuff growing up. honestly, if i was a kid again, and gender specific stuff was around, i'd end up doing both the co-eds and this. i would strongly dislike being encouraged to stick to girls-only stuff and stay away from co-ed stuff (warned that a guy might win, or i'm not smart enough for that). it would be demeaning."
56,"i think that, when it comes to competition, female empowerment means men and women competing all together. when a ""female-only science fair"" is created, for example, i believe it's implied that females could not compete in the regular/male science fair because they're not as competent in that field."
57,"not a fan. there are studies that suggest the more you integrate groups that are singled out of the ""norm"" the more the people that are part of the ""norm"" will be likely to simply accept women, african americans, asians, hispanics, etc. as part of the ""norm""."
58,"no thanks. i think to make a playing field equal, everyone needs to take the same shots and let the product speak for itself. if people think there will be a gender bias, try to have it blind judged."
59,"as stated before i think that interaction between both sexes and requiring males and females to overcome their ""differences"" will be the best way to empower women. life is not split based on gender and often won't compensate for gender differences. women need to learn the skills required to cope with these differences and hopefully along the way will teach men a little too."
60,"no! these should 100% be inclusive of everyone - male, female, other. the real world is not ever defined as ""female only"". we earned a right to stand next to men a long time ago, so why don't we move past traditional times and step into the present to define our future?"
61,"again, see above."
62,why segregate women from something they are equally capable as men of doing? it's a bad idea.
63,"i like this idea because, like gender specific interest groups, they create a space for empowerment, connection, and support. that said, when it comes to competition, i think you want to compete against the best of the best- are the best only female or only male? of course not. maybe these are places to get your foot in the door- a less intimating way to compete in your first science fair than an open to all one, but ultimately i would want to compete against the best of the best."
64,sure bring the women together and have a science fair whatever some women would really like that but again i'm not into it. let's just have a science fair.
65,i think the division speaks louder than the inclusion.
66,"ridiculous. i think it's absurd to assume that women need their own competitions because that perpetuates the idea that they're incapable of holding their own in normal competitions. it brings up the idea of separate but equal, which we know isn't equal. if we're trying to push towards a more integrated and tolerant world, we need to encourage women to take part in existing competitions, show men that women are more than capable, and break down those barriers through shared experiences. the work place doesn't segregate by gender; not encouraging men and women to work together and compete together is doing both men and women a disservice."
67,"disagree. on an intellectual level, men and women should be treated equally."
68,"do those exist?? i don't like that at all!! gender/race specific interest groups usually help provide support, guidance and opportunities to help even the playing field. gender specific academic/skill competitions suggest that men and women are not on an equally apt in academia (or whatever skill), and therefore cannot compete against one another, which goes against the entire purpose of feminism."
69,"creating these gender specific academic competitions, to me, marginalizes the capabilities of women. we should be competing as equals to our male counterparts. gender should not predispose or predilect our intelligence."
70,i think these programs are fine so long as they are prepared to see gender as a spectrum. if someone earnestly identifies as a woman despite a lack of female genetalia then they should not be barred from participating.
71,"as long as there are equivalent opportunities for the other genders or a competition that is inclusive for all, then i think they can be empowering if executed well (otherwise, one might question the impact of specifically isolating a gender in a skillset as if to say they are inherently disadvantaged in that skillset)"
72,"no opinion, never seen one irl"
73,"anybody should have the option to have activities tailored to specific groups, but i feel diversity can be compromised"
74,nah
75,same as above.
76,"while i agree that gender specific competitions are sometimes necessary to initially break preexisting barriers and provide gender-specific education needed to achieve parity, i think that the ultimate gender equality comes when both genders are equally equipped and can compete as equals with a fair playing field."
77,that's fine. women often can't beat men in mixed gender competitions even when they should
78,"disagree heavily - skill sets are not determined by gender, sex, or orientation"
79,i don't care much for it. i don't partake in it.
80,"i've never heard of that. i think if the goal is fostering an interest in those activities, than cool, but if you wanna be the best, you gotta beat the best, and not letting everyone compete diminishes any victory."
81,"i think it's overrated -- groups are a different thing, but competing and exclusion are overboard"
82,"i am slightly not in favor of these types of events, to the extent that it may reinforce narratives that different genders are competing at different levels."
83,"i think it is good if trying to grow interest in the area and build confidence to encourage them to try. there have long been male specific organizations and activities and still to this day. must be done carefully and in a way that empowers. can be done badly though, so be careful."
84,my only concern would be that females would not have the chance to prove that they are at a level equal to or above men.
85,"great as a means to achieve the attention and support necessary to gain balance in equality, but futile if there is not also a mixed-gender competition that coexists. whichever group is at a disadvantage needs the ability to compete with other groups as a means to understand and correct the gap."
86,that they are not needed.
87,"i think they are great when done in solidarity like hack-a-thons with women or young girls or stem and steam events and competitions for females promoting awareness around a certain topic or subject area where they should be more women. i don't believe they are good outside of that, at least i cannot think of an example where they would be off the top of my head. the more chances males and females are able to compete against one another, the more opportunity women have to to prove themselves."
88,havn't developed a strong opinion
89,they should be kept to the same standards as all groups.
90,"i think i mentioned this above, but i would love to live in a world where these weren't necessary. i also think that some of these competitions become easier to write off because of gender bias—""oh, well if she had competed in the larger competition..."" 

however, i think that these do also decrease the anxiety-barrier-to-entry, and also have a sense of community that is equal to if not more than the sense of competition."
91,"not a fan. i don't like the idea of ""doing well, for a woman (or any race/gender/diverse faction)."""
92,i strongly dislike them. they realistically should be based on parental income or school district to more realistically equalize the competitive environments.
93,"i'm not sure why this would be a thing. i think we should be measured by the same yard stick, so not sure why we would need female only science fairs etc."
94,don't agree
95,"don't believe in using competition to generate interest in things like stem in the broader female population in areas where stereotypes exist as any failure can negatively reinforce stereotypes; they have a place and can work well for some...but they also can have great risks at alienating, furthering stereotypes or stereotype threat, etc."
96,fine. increase female involvement in sciences.
97,same as about gender specific interest groups
98,"i don't think there's anything inherently wrong with that, but i'd prefer mixed over specific. this differs more by person though - i honestly think it's more fun with more people from different backgrounds."
99,"i don't have a ton of opinions here but i feel like if it floats your boat, ok."
100,"i don't agree with them because it is suggesting that women cannot compete with men, or vise versa. women are just as capable of competing in these events and shouldn't need to be marginalized to be given their own event in order to have a ""fair chance""."
101,i'm less of a fan. i think gender shouldn't matter in such competitions.
102,"i think academic/skill competitions that are gender specific are unnecessary. rather than acting as a support system, they segregate women from men. if they are within a specific support group (i.e. girls who code) that is different, however. a random ""females only competition in _____"" just weird, to me."
103,i don't see an issue with them.
104,"what could possibly be gained by segregating people in competitions in which gender offers no competitive advantage? for example, in cooking competitions, science fairs or math competitions women and men are equal. the playing field is level. people who want to win want to best all comers."
105,they end up not preparing participants for the real world
106,level playing field
107,"if there is a female only science fair, there needs to also be opportunity for a male only science fair."
108,that would definitely be sexist.
109,"it seems disingenuous. to exclude any population only demeans the value of success. i would never want a boys only science fair because then a girl could rationalize the argument that i hadn't fully proven superiority there, since she didn't have the opportunity to best me."
110,"they shouldn't be a thing. i do not believe there is any difference between the mental power of either sex, therefore we should all be judged equally based on skill and merit."
111,"not necessary -- i believe both genders are perfectly capable of competing in academic or skill specific settings. gender specific competitions only emphasize a perceived ""gap"" or insufficiency. what does having an all girls science fair say about girls? that they are not able to compete with boys?"
