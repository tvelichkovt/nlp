"* From and currently in StLouis, MO, USA, and grew up in a Catholic middle income family with hard-working parents who raised me and my 3 siblings to work hard and ACHIEVE!
* Learned early that parts of me (curiosity, intensity, feelings, questions, emotions) were ""too much"" for many, not in line with the religious/social teachings of the times - and toning that down, shrinking, and being more accepting of ""how things were"" made people happier with me.
* Also learned early that SUCCESS (not failure) = love, recognition, respect, acceptanceAnd that didDecided to never get a ""B"" again after 4th grade and achieved that through my Master's Degree (Industrial/Organization Psychology with a heavy emphasis on training).
Along with playing at high levels in soccer, softball, basketball -- soccer through and after college on a competitive women's teamAny job got, did well from radio producer to recruiter to trainer to project manager.
* Married a great guy who was also at the top of his game -- besides a job, he was an MLS and FIFA referee (he has reffed Man City, Man U, Fulham, Everton, Chelsea, and the English National Team for you UK-ers and plenty of other international teams).
* Blessed with 4 beautiful kids (ages 5-14) - but got lost living in the shadows and stepping back from my own pursuits to support the family -- doing projects/jobs for others just to stay relevant but not really wanting to do any of it.
* Manage Multiple Sclerosis and survived a near-stroke with Post-Partum PreEclampsia after my last childIn the last 5 years, I've come back from severe weight gain from those issues, fought hypertension, had back surgery that let me walk again back in December, and JUST found have an adrenal tumor making 10x toxic levels of a hormone - doc says he wonders how I've functioned much less ran a soccer club coaching 3 of my own teams while nursing a baby and running 3 other kids around when my spouse was hardly home.
GOOD NEWS? It's not cancer and removal will turn my life around in terms of not living in a fog anymore
* Bottom line -- know how to battleI've done it before and I'll finally get there with this great course.",

"Hello! My name is Elena :)

am currently working as an art teacher at an after-school art studio in Cupertino, CAhave two bachelor's degreesThe first in Studio Art and the second in Digital Art and Animation.

I've always struggled with trying to figure out what really want to do with my lifeGoing to art school seemed like an obvious choice because I've always been a talented artistArt has never been my only interest thoughI'm at a point right now where I've been trying to get my foot in the door at a larger company with digital art, illustration, or animationI've outgrown my current job teaching childrenfeel bored, like I'm not putting my potential to useknow have much more to offer; and truthfully, these digital art jobs I've been applying to don't spark my interest the way they shouldcan't imagine myself being happy sitting in-doors all day behind a computer, illustrating someone else's vision.

So, about two years ago became very interested in ""personal development""My ex introduced me to the genre and some really great booksThen my world was flipped upside down when found out he'd been deceiving me, lying, and cheated on me in the endThat's when dove head-first into self-developmentwas reading and listening to podcasts and YouTube videos nonstopIt kept me going and helped me come to terms with what had happenedAfter one book in particular, even diagnosed my ex as a narcissist with BPD and unresolved childhood traumaIt's reassuring to know it never could have workedPoint is, turned a very painful event into a priceless learning opportunity full of personal growthThe positive changes I've seen in myself have inspired me to want to help others do the same.

During the Covid 19 quarantine these last few months, I've been teaching my students online via ZoomAs adjusted to the new program, schedule, and online setup, began to see numerous positive points about working from homeNot only that, also realized how much enjoy simply talking to people remotely over a webcamSure, missed seeing the kids in person, but the whole online thing really grew on meIt also pushed me to be more clear, concise, engaging, and animated, to compensate for the poor video and audio quality, while still entertaining and brightening the kids' dayThis experience showed me that maybe could love and excel at more than just artAs someone who has historically been painfully shy with low self esteem, can barely believe how far I've comenow dream about running a successful YouTube channel where can reach out to help young people with all of the same issues I've overcomeIn fact, the same week discovered The Coaching Masters, also finally started working on my channel.

really want to help people, and the more learn about TCM the more feel coaching could be my calling.

apologize for this being quite longYou did say, ""Details, details, details!"" So that's about it :)",

Where do start?! I'm a 24 year old psychology graduate (graduated this crazy year! go me!) and am looking for a career this is fufiling to me and my soulAfter studying my degree realised to do the things that want to do which is influence and teach people how to obtain and progress in self-discovery,awareness and love as individuals, spiritual beings and in relationship had to go through a very extensive process of education and obtain experience in fields that had no interest inAnd even in doing so would most likely only obtain the role of a counsellor or clinical psychologistA counsellor, found through completing my degree, was all about listening to patients and not interfering or offering any advice or therapy, and a clinical psychologist spent most of their day prescribing medications and diagnosis rather than psychological or holistic services (more often than not)Baring this in mind am a multi-faceted creative soul (singer-songwriter, pianist, creative writer) who has some symptoms of ADHD and didn't want to dedicate my entire life to a mundane and soul training professionRecently have embarked on a spiritual journey that has honestly changed my life perspective and was feeling more drawn to being a life and relationships coach.",

really excited about this! I’m in my mid forties and am a wheelchair user with a spinal injuryhad a serious accident 23 years ago and have been a wheelchair user ever sinceObviously this has brought many challenges but also many gifts, like increased empathy and understanding of situations out of our control.

thought the Police was a family and that would be looked after when needed helpWhen 4 members of my family, in quick succession, were diagnosed with cancer (2 of them terminally) lost all motivationAt an appraisal told my sergeant what was going on2 weeks later the same sergeant told me was underperforming and started to make my life a living hellfought against the situation for 18 months, however this resulted in me making myself ill and being off work for 6 months

then transferred back to uniform as was tired of fightingthen had more supportive line managers and things got better, but at the back of my mind could not get over the way have previously been treated

gave my all to policing and when needed help was kicked when was downvowed never to treat anyone the way was treated.

My dad passed away in October 2019I’ll always remember sitting by his bedside as he was dying and getting a text from my then Inspectorwas supposed to be on night shift that nightThe text said he could not give me more than 2 days special leave and to sign myself on sick leaveAgain, not the most supportive experience have ever had from the organisation.

Fast forward a few years and am now a temporary sergeant myself and running a shift in a newly created unitfocus on welfare of my staff, something that was never afforded to me.

still long for freedom and more time with my familyIn these 14 years have 3 Christmas’ off, have missed countless family events and am constantly tired

know was put on this world to help peoplethought the Police was the best way could do thatHow wrong was I!

"am David and am from Barcelonajust watched the 7 stages of hunger video and can't believe went already through all of them and am right now in taking actionLet me put you into situation: I'm 24 and two years ago finished Aeronautical managementBut that was not my passion, did it because had to do a degreeSo did it but once finished it noticed my passion was footballFor more than 10 years enjoying football and always hearing you'll not live from thatI'm a Barça fan and my dream was to enjoy a Champions league match in the Stadium and once finally achieved it it was amazingAfter that, wanted friends to experience the same ""pleasure"" had so helped them to go to the stadiumBut getting tickets for the most hot events is not easy at all, and noticed was capable of getting themBut once stopped doing that because could be badly seen, limited myself to get it for me and enjoyWhen finished my degree noticed was not passionate for flights and airplanes (like travelling, so as had to do ""something"" did that)After graduation, decided to start IT Engineering because everyone told me was good at computers so thought it was the best to doBut quickly noticed would go again through the aeronautical situationBut had to do something, but what? Btw, kept going to the Camp Nou and watching football!! In parallel, had an idea of building a ticketing business but all were problems and regrets, so did not take action at allJust wrote a couple of pages but not much moreSuddently, the 24-April-2019 had the opportunity of my life: saw in a Whatsapp group that a ticket broker was looking for a assistantAnd thought, this must happen for a reasonhave to do whatever to get more information, not only for a way to follow in my life (as IT was not the right one at all, knew it from months ago) but also for the business project had in mindSo managed to get an interview and got that positionThat day completely changed my life: had the answer to what love to: ticketing broker in footballBut that's what love, not my goalIn fact, my goal: financial freedom, these two words are the ones that brought me to the coaching mastersMaybe I'll have to talk about this later, let me returnFrom the first day knew that if wanted to run a business had to know the suppliers, how to sell and how to move around the sectorNow see that this has helped me in the journey but could have started myself and would have found the way tooLet's say that the job position was more important for me for two reasons which are not monetary: 1/ Seeing that love this ticketing world and feel super comfortable in it2/ Learning from all the experience of running this kind of business in order to not commit the same errors in the pastIn fact, felt very identified with the perfection issue(Sorry if i'm extending too much).
Once the lockdown arrived due to covid-19, could have waited for football fans to come back or explore other worldslove football but my goal is freedomwant time to enjoy in football, friends, travel, etcAnd noticed that the tourist/event/ticketing sector will not be efficient in a short termBut always believe there's opportunities, so said to myself to think in something but did not think quite much to be honestThe 4-April-2020 received a phone call from a ticket customer (which has become a friend) talking to me about cryptocurrenciesAt first thought, omg again someone trying to introduce me a productBut then thought, you have always had that feeling to want to know how the crypto world worksNow you don't have the time excuse so let's go for itSo for a month started to investigate in cryptocurrencies and after a month started to invest and right now that's giving me money every single day which is great!!! But something that learned during this coronavirus period is that you can't rely on one thing because if this goes away you're left with anythingIf you've 5 things and 4 fall you still have that oneOnce being familiarized with crypto, thought, there must be loads of people wanting to enter to the crypto world but it's not easy at allcan help them by managing the investments, helping them to get their way in this worldSo started to phone people and just heard a NO afer NOnoticed something went wrong, but having NO's was good (can say that now), because it meant was tryingAnd suddently, after one month (start may-2020) my best friend taught me that there's a collegue from hospital that thinks he needs a talk with meSo we organised a lunch in his flat and suddently realized it was an amazing ideaNot only for his project but also for mine: He is an expert in surebets and wanted to manage people's investments in betting but did not know how to continueIt was then when realised it was my bridge from the real world to the crypto oneHearing a NO after NO made me conclude that they needed the same needed before: getting from one side of the river to the other oneAnd the best way was to build a bridgeLet me explain myself: Loads of people have heard about sports betting and may know or heard at least one betting houseThis will allow to ""present"" an investment product easier due to the familiarity of the betting houses (in tv, in newspapers, in panels, etc)And once the customer sees there's benefits week after week, believe sooner or later they will ask us if we have something else a part from surebetsAnd here's where the crypto investments start
During this last month have been working with him in this projectHe needed someone to go forward and with me we started to move forwardThe two main requests were: 1- finding someone to develop the software for surebets (we both agreed that we had to find someone to integrate in the project as they have to feel it him's or her's); 2- getting to know if it was legal to do all thatAnd in fact yesterday we had a call and he told me: can't believe that in less than a month we already found the IT member and managed to prove the viability of the project.
Sorry again if I'm too longam currently still working with the ticketing broker (not quite much to do now with the lockdown) and am dedicating all my effort in this projectAnd once the lawyer told me it was completely viable thought, this has no stopWe will do it and no voice or false belief will stop itThanks for reading all this :)",

Life was going pretty well, dabbled in all sorts after selling my nails salons, including coaching women, then ran my husbands refrigeration and air-conditioning company for 6 years until October 2019 when the crap really hit the fan and we lost our business, it was liquidated and we pretty much lost everything financially and have also been left with a very large debt we are personally liable for(112k) 
This was our very lowest time in our lives as a couple and as individuals, but we have picked ourselves up up, dusted off and working our way through things, we had both just taken new jobs Then covid hit You couldn't have made it up! So we both lost our jobs, mine was only casual anyway but for James it was another huge blow.

So move on a few months, completed my NLP Practicioner course, and made the decision would go back to what love and build a serious business within coachingIt's taken some real effort, soul searching and finally really realised what am here forYou will see from the picture below with a before and after, stopped drinking was a big drinker, actually from a family where both sides have serious alcohol issues, so it was a very big thing for me to doas it was a huge part of my lifeBut OMG have literally changed my life in 1 short year from stopping drinking!!! 

So this is the area want to help women with, am passionate about helping them cut out the alcohol and bring out their creative, passionate and positive energies and build abundant lives!
have built my own website (god that took some serious patience) and have programmes ready to go but my challenge and struggle is getting to my audience, have done all the work for the ideal client, avatar, live videos, positive posts, offers, groups etc etc etc but am still struggling to get people interested and in all honesty this week have taken a job because financially can't keep sitting & waiting for something to happen, we are on our knees.

It's my turn to give James a break in life, he has always supported absolutely every idea, business and craziness have wanted to do, he works his backside off and want to retire him from the fridge world, want to clear the debt, ultimately want to help women!!!
That is a very short version on my life haha, wear my heart on my sleeve and couldn't put just one picture James, Sienna and of course Roscoe are my life and want to make it a phenomenal one, Sienna sings and it ain't cheap to get into that world as am finding out, so again need to have the finances there to support her.
So my hope is in here is that will get ideas for marketing, finding clients and building this coaching business to phenomenal levels! keep waking up wth the same dream, help 1 million women become alcohol free & abundant.

After school completed a 4 year degree in International Business and Spanish, getting to live and travel spain and learn their language and culture for a year really made me love travelling and wanting to do it more after completed my university courseSo a few months after college luckily landed a job in a premium chain gym in Dublin doing sales there, selling is something have a passion for and obviously being a fitness lover, was being paid an alright salary and decent commission to sell a beautiful gym, pool, sauna, and steam room to the public interestedreally enjoyed this and had a lot of fun, it was a great experience for a 22 year old straight out of collegeworked there just under a year and saved up enough to get a working holiday visa for Australia and went there for a year which was the best year of my lifeMy main goals there were to travel the east coast of Auz, do farm work to be granted a second year but to have fun and make some cool friends, and travel most of south east asia Asia after, meet new people, go out and just have a great time and completed all of themreturned from Vietnam to Ireland last September and although was absolutely skint, it was all worth itSo being broke was extremely motivated to make money and it made me realize never want to be financially struggling again, so got my job back straight away in the old gym with a better salary and commission and have done very well the last 7 or 8 months working there and have managed to save up the most money have saved so far, but my goals are a lot bigger than working hereIt was just easy to go back at the time because it was offered to me instantly after my travels so thats the main reason went back

just feel like I’m just drifting through life, going to work each day but it’s not fulfilling my purpose? Like I’m missing out on something? Like there must be more to life than stuck in a 9-5 job that you hate doing, but doing it because it pay the bills.

have this believe that am not good enough to do the work want to doNot educated enough, not confident enough to show up and be consistent, not unique enough.

Fear, self-doubt, overwhelm and being an introvertAll blocks, limitations put on myself, have been holding me back from moving forward and having the impact want to have in the world.

My mind is constantly running away from me and I’m so restlessProcrastinating is also playing a big role in my lifewill start a course, etc, but because I’m quickly getting bored, change to something else and never finish a coursealso will browse for ages on social media, reading other peoples success stories, but again think my limiting beliefs are stepping in and holding me back from doing what should do with my lifeWhen see all the people being so successful around me, I’m starting to feel demotivated, because feel have been struggling all my life and still do and for some reason can’t move passed feeling so overwhelmed

I’m in a constant battle with myself every day, as know deep down I’m not fulfilling my purposeI’m not doing what meant to do here on earthfeel like I’m a total failure, not just to myself, but to my family too.

"Luan Ashfield
29 years old 
Married for just over 3 years
Been with my husband since we met on holiday 10 years ago - we both love to travel so took 6 months out of work a few years ago to go backpacking (use that term loosely as we still stayed in nicer places, not a hostel kind of couple!), and we go on luxury holidays every year 
Moved in to our 500k home in Bristol almost a year ago, and suddenly the long mortgage seems less appealing when it means we will have to cut back on the holidays
We have 2 cats, no children - although we are currently facing the dilemma of children vs no children (one of the main reasons am here at TCM)
have a First Class degree in Business Enterprise, and have worked for my family business on and off since graduating
To get other experience (rather than just going straight to the family business and looking like have taken the 'easy' path) have worked in sales, recruitment and training - most recently (before joining my family business full time), was travelling around the country training legal professionals in local governments on a legal software (this was classroom training and 121 sessions) 
decided to quit that training job and move to the family business full time as the travel meant was away from home 3-4 nights a week (which hated) - and wasn't keen on someone else being full responsible for my schedule
Our family business offers Construction Services (such as admin/procurement) so we are very much 'on call' to our clients at all times - which hasn't turned out to the the flexible job hoped it would be.
On top of that, run all of the business admin (technology, subscriptions, accounting, invoicing etc) due to being the only family member that has the skills/qualifications.",
